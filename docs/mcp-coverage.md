# MCP coverage ledger (spec-v183)

This is the honest coverage record for the optional stdio MCP server
(`mcp/server.js`). It lists exactly which catalog calculators are exposed as
deterministic MCP tools. `scripts/check-mcp-catalog.mjs` asserts that the
**Exposed** list below equals the live adapter registry (`mcp/catalog.js`)
exactly — no more, no less — and that each exposed example round-trips.

The MCP coverage count is a **subset** of the catalog and is deliberately
**not** one of the 13 catalog-truth count surfaces (spec-v46): it must never be
conflated with `UTILITIES.length`. The live total is reported at runtime by
`list_calculators` (`"<N> of <M> catalog tiles exposed"`), never hardcoded here.

Adapting the catalog is incremental, module by module, against a fixed contract
(`mcp/fields.js`): an adapter declares only the input schema and two pure mapping
functions; the name, group, specialties, citation, example, and interpretation
are read from `UTILITIES` and `META`, never re-typed.

## First wave (spec-v183) — 4 modules

The proof-of-pattern slice: 21 clinical calculators across 4 `lib` modules, each
with a JSON-Schema input contract, an example that round-trips to its
`META.example.expected`, a citation echoed from `META`, and a clinical-posture
disclaimer.

## Second wave — 4 modules

Coverage extends, module by module against the same fixed contract, with 18 more
clinical calculators across 4 `lib` modules (pulmonary function, hemorrhagic
stroke / SAH / IVH, metabolic / endocrine, and perioperative risk). Two tiles in
these modules are intentionally not adapted: `phases-iph` has no `META.example`
to round-trip, and `pospom` takes a variable-length comorbidity array that needs
a bespoke `toArgs` (deferred). Subset exposure of a module is fine — the ledger
lists exactly which ids are live.

## Exposed

Each id below is live in `mcp/catalog.js`. The gate parses this list.

## Not yet adapted

Every other catalog calculator is **not-yet-adapted**. Reason: incremental
rollout — subsequent waves extend coverage module by module against the same
contract. The Group A/B billing and coding tiles (`clinical: false`) are
out of scope for the first wave (spec-v183 §7) and are eligible only in a later
wave. No proprietary/licensed instrument is ever exposed (it is not in the
catalog to begin with; spec-v100 §8 exclusions are inherited).
